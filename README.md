Vpython need to be installed: https://vpython.org/

Prototype for a physics engine, made with vpython.
Currently somewhat capable of collisions and not much else.

Todo:

- Test different numerical solvers.

- Improve collision calculations.

- Add coefficient of restitution on collisions.

- Add friction on collisions and springs.

- Add possibilty for springs between particles.
